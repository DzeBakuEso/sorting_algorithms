# 0x1B. C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## Project Overview
This project covers the implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms in C, focusing on understanding their efficiencies through Big O notation in different cases (best, average, and worst). The project is completed in teams, adhering to specific coding style and repository management guidelines.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Implement different sorting algorithms in C.
- Understand the Big O complexity of each algorithm in various scenarios.
- Apply coding style conventions as per the Betty standard.
- Follow best practices in GitHub repository management.

## Requirements
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Coding Style:** Betty Style
- **Compiler:** gcc (version specified by ALX)
- **No global variables** are allowed.
- A **README.md** file is mandatory.
- Restricted use of standard library functions unless specified.
- All implementations must strictly follow guidelines as provided.

## Mandatory Tasks
1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Function to implement Bubble Sort.
   - Analyze and document its Big O complexity.

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - Implement Insertion Sort algorithm.
   - Document complexity across cases.

3. **Selection Sort**
   - Function to execute Selection Sort.
   - Explain complexity in best, average, and worst cases.

4. **Helper Functions**
   - Additional helper functions required for sorting tasks.

## Advanced Tasks
- **Shell Sort**
   - Implement and analyze Shell Sort.
- **Cocktail Shaker Sort**
   - Extended implementation and Big O analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source files using the specified gcc compiler.
3. Run the executable to test sorting functions on sample data.
